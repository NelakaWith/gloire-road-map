# Portfolio-friendly Feature Ideas for Gloire Road Map

This document lists high-impact features you can add to the project to make it stand out in your portfolio. Each idea includes: why it helps, a short user story, suggested tech, difficulty estimate, a tiny contract (inputs/outputs/acceptance), edge-cases to watch, and quick demo ideas.

## Top 3 recommendations (pick 1–3)

1. Analytics dashboard (goal completion, trends, cohort stats) — high impact, medium effort
2. Roles & permissions (Admin / Student / Mentor + invite flows) — shows full-stack auth/ACL capability, medium effort
3. Public demo + one-click deploy (Docker + GitHub Actions + live URL) — shows ops skills, low–medium effort

## Feature ideas (details)

### 1) Analytics dashboard (charts, trends, cohorts)

- Why: Visual, data-driven features look great on a portfolio and show data modeling and UI skills.
- User story: "As an admin I can see goal completion rates, active students, and goal timelines for date ranges."
- Tech: Vue + Chart.js/ECharts; backend aggregation endpoints (Express); SQL aggregations.
- Difficulty: Medium
- Contract:
  - Inputs: date range, optional filter (student, cohort)
  - Outputs: JSON with totals, percentages, trends
  - Acceptance: Charts render sensibly for sample data; endpoints return results.
- Edge cases: empty data ranges, timezone handling, very large ranges (add sampling).
- Demo: animated charts, screenshot/GIF for README.

### 2) Roles & permissions (Admin / Student / Mentor + invite flows)

- Why: Demonstrates security, auth, multi-user flows.
- User story: "Admins can invite mentors/students; invited users accept and receive scoped access."
- Tech: DB role column, invite token flow, email (SMTP or mock), frontend role-aware routes.
- Difficulty: Medium–High
- Contract:
  - Inputs: invite {email, role}
  - Outputs: pending invite, accept creates user with role
  - Acceptance: Admin-only routes are protected; invites handled safely.
- Edge cases: expired tokens, invites to existing accounts.

### 3) CSV & iCal export for goals (calendar integration)

- Why: Practical feature; great for portfolio screenshots and small to implement.
- Story: "Export a student's goal deadlines to iCal or CSV for calendar import."
- Tech: CSV / .ics generator in backend, frontend download button.
- Difficulty: Low–Medium
- Contract: studentId + date range → downloadable file (.csv or .ics)
- Edge cases: timezone handling, recurring goals.

### 4) Notifications & reminders (email + in-app)

- Why: Shows async/background jobs and UX polish (reminders before a target_date).
- Tech: cron jobs or queue (Bull + Redis) or scheduled job, email via nodemailer, in-app with polling or WebSocket.
- Difficulty: Medium–High
- Contract: schedule reminder for goal → email + in-app notification

### 5) Real-time activity feed (WebSocket)

- Why: Demonstrates real-time features like socket.io and shows modern UX.
- Story: "See live updates when a goal is created or completed by another user."
- Tech: socket.io, frontend subscription.
- Difficulty: High

### 6) Comments, mentions, and attachments on goals

- Why: Makes content richer and demonstrates file uploads and parsing.
- Tech: comments API, attachment upload endpoint (S3/local), mention parsing, notifications.
- Difficulty: Medium

### 7) Goal templates & bulk creation

- Why: Practical UX for power users and shows batch operations.
- Tech: template CRUD, bulk insert endpoint.
- Difficulty: Low–Medium

### 8) Progress automation & gamification (streaks, badges)

- Why: Nice UI and gamification make the project engaging for reviewers.
- Tech: computed streaks or scheduled jobs for badge awarding.
- Difficulty: Medium

### 9) Rich editor for goal descriptions + attachments

- Why: Demonstrates integration with WYSIWYG editors and secure file handling.
- Tech: TipTap/Quill + file upload handling and HTML sanitization.
- Difficulty: Medium

### 10) Public demo & API docs (OpenAPI + Swagger)

- Why: Makes it easy for reviewers to try the app and demonstrates API design.
- Tech: swagger-ui-express, OpenAPI spec, Postman collection.
- Difficulty: Low

### 11) CI tests and E2E (Cypress) with visual regression

- Why: Shows professional engineering practices and improves confidence in releases.
- Tech: Cypress, GitHub Actions matrix, optional Percy for visual regression.
- Difficulty: Medium

## Quick starter plans

- Analytics dashboard (2–4 days): backend `/api/analytics` endpoints, frontend `AnalyticsView.vue` with Chart.js, add link in header.
- Roles & permissions (3–5 days): add `role` to users, middleware, admin-only pages, invite flow.
- Deployable demo + Docker (1–2 days): Dockerfiles, docker-compose, README quick-deploy section, optional GitHub Pages or small droplet demo.

## Visual & portfolio extras

- High-quality screenshots or short GIFs of analytics and admin pages.
- A 30–60s demo video.
- A public demo URL (hosted) so reviewers can click and explore.
- A "How it was built" section in README describing implementation highlights.

If you want, I can scaffold one of the features now. Tell me which feature to start with and I will implement the first slice and push changes to the repo.
